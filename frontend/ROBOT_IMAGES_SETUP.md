# Robot Images Setup - Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. Dependencies Added
- Added assets configuration for `assets/images/` directory
- Removed `flutter_svg` dependency (no longer needed for PNG-only approach)

### 2. Code Changes

#### AppDrawer (frontend/lib/presentation/widgets/app_drawer.dart)
- Removed `flutter_svg` import
- Updated `_buildDrawerButton` method to support PNG icons
- Modified Robots menu item to use PNG icon: `assets/images/robot_icon.png`
- Uses standard Flutter `Image.asset` widget for PNG display

#### RobotsPage (frontend/lib/presentation/pages/robots_page.dart)
- Updated robot avatar to use PNG image: `assets/images/robot_avatar.png`
- Added fallback to text display if image is not available
- Maintained existing functionality while adding image support

### 3. Assets Created
- Created `assets/images/` directory
- Added `README.md` with instructions for adding PNG files

## Files to Add Manually

You need to add the following files to `frontend/assets/images/`:
- `robot_icon.png` - Square PNG image for drawer menu icon (24x24 or 32x32 recommended)
- `robot_avatar.png` - Square PNG image for robot avatars (64x64 or 128x128 recommended)

## How It Works

1. **PNG Icon in Drawer**: The robot menu item in the drawer displays a custom PNG icon with theme-adaptive colors
2. **PNG Avatar in List**: Robot cards display PNG images as avatars without background circles, in original colors
3. **Theme Adaptation**: Only the drawer icon adapts its colors to match the current app theme (light/dark mode)
4. **Graceful Fallback**: If images are missing, the app will still work and display appropriate fallbacks

## Testing

1. Add your `robot_icon.png` file to `assets/images/` (for drawer menu)
2. Add your `robot_avatar.png` file to `assets/images/` (for robot avatars)
3. Run the app and check:
   - Drawer menu shows robot PNG icon
   - Robots list shows PNG avatars (or text fallback)

## Updated Approach

- Simplified to use PNG images only (no SVG dependencies)
- Uses standard Flutter image widgets for better performance
- Easier to manage and customize PNG assets
- Theme-adaptive colors only for drawer icon using ColorFilter with BlendMode.srcIn
- No background circles for avatars (transparent overlay)
- Robot avatars display in original colors (no color filtering)
- Drawer icon uses monochrome PNG that adapts to current theme colors
